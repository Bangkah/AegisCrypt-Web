AegisCrypt Web is a military-grade, browser-based encryption tool. It is designed to be **Zero-Knowledge**, meaning your files and passwords are processed entirely in your browser's RAM via Web Assembly / Web Crypto API and never transmitted to any server.

## ✨ Features at a Glance

*   **🔒 AES-256-GCM**: Authenticated encryption that detects tampering.
*   **🔑 Two-Factor Authentication**: Combine `Password` + `Keyfile` (e.g., a photo, a document) for ultimate security.
*   **🌊 Streaming Engine (v2)**: Encrypts multi-gigabyte files without crashing the browser (low RAM footprint).
*   **🎨 Cyberpunk Glass UI**: A fully responsive, modern interface with real-time animations.
*   **⚡ Real-time Telemetry**: View encryption speed (MB/s) and ETA.
*   **📁 Batch Processing**: Drag & drop entire folders to process queue.

## 🔒 Security Architecture

AegisCrypt follows strict cryptographic standards to ensure data integrity and confidentiality.

### 1. Core Algorithm
*   **Cipher:** AES-256-GCM (Galois/Counter Mode).
*   **Why GCM?**: Unlike CBC, GCM provides **Authenticated Encryption**. It ensures that if a file is tampered with (even a single bit changed), decryption will fail immediately instead of producing garbage data.

### 2. Key Derivation (PBKDF2)
*   **Function:** `PBKDF2` with `HMAC-SHA-256`.
*   **Iterations:** 100,000 (exceeds NIST recommendations for password hashing).
*   **Salt:** 32-byte Cryptographically Secure Random Salt generated per file.
*   **Purpose:** Protects against Brute-Force and Rainbow Table attacks.

### 3. Keyfile Logic (2FA)
*   **Logic:** `KeyMaterial = Password_Bytes + SHA256(Keyfile_Bytes)`
*   This ensures that even if an attacker guesses your password, they cannot decrypt the file without the exact physical file used as the key.

### 4. Streaming Encryption (v2)
*   Files are broken into **1MB Chunks**.
*   Each chunk has a **Unique IV (Initialization Vector)**.
*   This prevents pattern analysis on large files and protects against IV reuse attacks.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
*   Node.js (v18+)
*   npm or yarn

### Installation
```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Bangkah/AegisCrypt-Web.git

# 2. Enter directory
cd AegisCrypt-Web

# 3. Install Dependencies

## 📖 User Guide

### Encryption Workflow
1.  **Login**: Enter a strong password. (Optional) Drag a random file (image, song, doc) into the Keyfile area.
2.  **Add Files**: Drag files or folders into the glass drop zone.
3.  **Encrypt**: Click the **Blue Lock Button**.
4.  **Wait**: Watch the progress bar. Large files are streamed efficiently.
5.  **Download**: The browser will auto-download `.aegis` files.

### Decryption Workflow
1.  **Login**: **MUST** use the exact same password (and Keyfile if used) as encryption.
2.  **Add Files**: Drag `.aegis` files into the zone.
3.  **Decrypt**: Click the **Dark Unlock Button**.
4.  **Result**: Original files are restored.

## ⚠️ FAQ & Troubleshooting

**Q: I lost my password/keyfile. Can you recover my data?**
> **No.** AegisCrypt is zero-knowledge. There are no backdoors. If credentials are lost, the data is mathematically unrecoverable.

**Q: Why does the browser ask for permission to download multiple files?**
> When processing a batch, the app triggers a download for each file. Browsers often block automatic multiple downloads. Please click "Allow" when prompted.

**Q: What is the maximum file size?**
> Tested up to **10GB** on Chrome 120+. The limitation is the browser's Blob implementation. For 100GB+ files, use the AegisCrypt Desktop (C#) version.
